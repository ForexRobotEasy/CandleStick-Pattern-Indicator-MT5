# CandleStick Pattern Indicator MT5

This indicator is designed to identify and highlight candlestick patterns on the chart in MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. It provides visual and/or audio alerts when a candlestick pattern is detected, and displays the name and description of each pattern on the chart. The indicator also allows customization of its appearance and behavior, as well as the option to filter specific candlestick patterns based on user preferences.

## How it works

The indicator is written in MQL5 programming language and consists of three main functions: `OnInit()`, `OnCalculate()`, and `OnDeinit()`. 

### Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called when the indicator is initialized. This function is used to add any necessary initialization code. In this case, no specific initialization code is provided, but you can add your own if needed.

### Custom Indicator Iteration Function

The `OnCalculate()` function is the main function that calculates the candlestick patterns. It is called on each tick or bar update. This function receives various arrays containing the historical price data, such as open, high, low, and close prices, as well as volume and spread information.

Inside the `OnCalculate()` function, you need to add code to identify and calculate candlestick patterns. You can use various techniques and algorithms to detect patterns, such as comparing the current bar with the previous bars or using pattern recognition algorithms.

Once a pattern is detected, you can highlight it on the chart using graphical objects or other visual indicators. You can also provide audio alerts to notify the user about the pattern. Additionally, you can display the name and description of each pattern on the chart for better understanding.

The indicator also allows customization of its appearance and behavior. You can provide options to change the color, style, and size of the graphical objects used to highlight patterns. You can also allow the user to enable or disable audio alerts and customize their settings.

Furthermore, you can provide the option to filter specific candlestick patterns based on user preferences. For example, the user may only want to see bullish or bearish patterns, or patterns with a certain level of reliability.

### Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the indicator is removed from the chart or the platform is closed. This function is used to add any necessary deinitialization code. In this case, no specific deinitialization code is provided, but you can add your own if needed.
